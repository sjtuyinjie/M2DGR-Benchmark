# M2DGR-Benchmark
Authors: Junjie Zhang(张骏杰), Deteng Zhang(张德腾), Yan Sun(孙岩) and [Jie Yin (殷杰)](https://sjtuyinjie.github.io/)*

This is a benchmark based on M2DGR and M2DGR-plus dataset with adapted SOTA SLAM algorithms. [M2DGR](https://github.com/SJTU-ViSYS/M2DGR) is a Multi-modal and Multi-scenario SLAM Dataset for Ground Robots（RA-L & ICRA2022), while [M2DGR-plus](https://github.com/SJTU-ViSYS/M2DGR-plus) is Extension and update of M2DGR (ICRA2022 & ICRA2024). This project aims to adapt SOTA LiDAR SLAM, Visual SLAM and sensor-fusion SLAM systems to the two datasets to facilitate the research community.

Currently, we support following algorithms:
